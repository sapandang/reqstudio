**reqstudio** is a powerful, open-source HTTP and REST API client that lives directly inside Visual Studio Code. It provides a rich, graphical interface for creating, sending, and testing API requests, all managed through simple, text-based `.req` files.

Stop switching windows to test your APIs. Keep your API requests version-controlled alongside your code.

## Installation

1.  Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2.  Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` (or `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac) to open the **Extensions** view.
3.  Search for `reqstudio`.
4.  Click **Install**.

---

## Getting Started

1.  **Create a file** in your project with the `.req` extension (e.g., `api.req`).
2.  **Open the file** in VS Code. The `reqstudio` UI will automatically appear.
3.  **Build your request** using the graphical interface:
    * Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
    * Enter the request URL.
    * Add any necessary parameters, headers, or a request body.
4.  **Click "Send"** to execute the request.
5.  View the response in the panel on the right.
6.  Click **"Save"** or press `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` to save your request configuration to the `.req` file.

### The `.req` File Format

Your requests are saved in a clean, human-readable JSON format. This allows you to easily view diffs in Git or even create requests programmatically.

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "[https://api.example.com/users](https://api.example.com/users)",
  "params": [
    {
      "key": "isActive",
      "value": "true",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "headers": [],
  "bodyType": "application/json",
